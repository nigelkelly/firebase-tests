Install
==============

Just download the test-base-client-1 and test-base-client-2 folders.

Open index.hmtl in each folder in your browser.

You now have 2 clients on your desktop hooked in with firebase.

Simply press the sync button. This will increment the value. The cool things is that you will see the result of this
click in the other browser window. 

##What is s really happening

Each time you press the sync button a new js object is created locally with unique key generated by firebase and a value.

> Click Sync
> creates {"new_firebase_key", "incremented_value"}

The object is then uploaded by magic to the firebase servers.

The .on() sync event in the code then picks up the change in the firebase servers. Hey Presto! The new firebase object
generated on client-1 gets downloaded to client-2 in milliseconds.
